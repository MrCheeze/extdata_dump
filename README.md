When run, you'll be presented with three options:

* Dump all extdata to sd card
* Dump extdata specified in config
* Restore extdata specified in config

I recommend just dumping all extdata to begin with, and browsing the dumps to see what you can find. There's a fair bit of documentation that might help you navigate the dumps [over on the 3dbrew wiki](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Extdata#SD_Extdata).

If you want to restore an edited file (or just want to dump a single file instead of all of them), you'll have to edit config.txt. I've included a few examples in there that should make the format clear.
